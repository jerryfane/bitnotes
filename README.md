# BitNotes

It has now become a habit for students, especially university students, to write their notes directly on their computer, or tablet, in digital format. Students spend hours and hours summarizing the concepts learned during long university courses through their lecture notes, which become a fundamental asset for studying and reflect the long and hard work of the student. 

Unfortunately, most of the time these notes, once used, completely lose any functionality, in particular for the student, who has already taken his exam and passed with honors. What is the solution? Earn from your old notes! With BitNotes this is possible! The first decentralized application that allows students to earn money by sharing their study materials.

Through BitNotes, any student can decide to turn their lecture notes into a digital assets living on the Ethereum blockchain. In this way you can re-evaluate the long hours of work spent to summarize clearly the lectures of your most-loved, or most-hated, course. Other students will have access to a variety of study materials that will help them to understand the most difficult concepts of these courses, and to study without necessarily having to spend more time summarizing the lectures. 

The Notes owners can lend their materials to other students in exchange for a small fee, or sell them directly for a higher price. In that case, ownership of the digital assets would be transferred, and the new owner could start earning money from these notes, even if they were not produced by him. In this way the lecture notes become a new form of digital assets, able to produce revenues similar to renting a house, and all operating over the Ethereum blockchain.
